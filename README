# simtask 
A Python package to facilitate automation of common simulation tasks, such as calculating
the density for various temperatures.

A Jupyter notebook tutorial can be found in 'docs/tutorials'. It is called 'dlmonte_gcmc.ipynb'.
A few examples can be found in 'docs/examples'; the comments in the Python files explain
what is going on.

Note that this package is still at the alpha stage, so please be kind!
